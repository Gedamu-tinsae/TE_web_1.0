# opencv

- so there are 30fps on the dash cam video
- the video is 60 secs long, hence 10 sec vid
- it takes about 3 secs to process a single frame 
- so: 30 x 60 x 3 = 5400 secs / 90 mins / 1:30 hrs / a full football match.
- 540 sec ~= 10 min

1sec - 30fps
       1 frame - 3 secs

- 1 min = 60 secs - 30fps - 3 secs = 1 min video takes 5400 secs = 90 min

------

## test - 1 :
- 10 sec vid = 319 frmaes = 652 secs = 11 mins - o/p was in wrong fps format

## test - 2 :
- 10 sec vid = 319 frmaes =  1115s ecs =  19 mins - faulty output
